# MVTec AD-C Robustness Benchmark: The Corrupted MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset

The automation of quality control is common and plays a major role in many industries. [MVTec AD](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad) is an excellent dataset for benchmarking anomaly detection (AD) methods. Researchers have made some achievements by unremitting efforts, and we are fortunate to witness the progress of anomaly detection algorithms ([Paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11263-020-01400-4.pdf), [Paper with code](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/anomaly-detection-on-mvtec-ad), [Anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib/tree/feature/fastflow)).

Although existing state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods get good results on the detection and segmentation task, **we notice that there are few studies about the model robustness**, i.e. the performance on the corrupted data. This repository contains the corrupted MVTec anomaly detection dataset for benchmarking AD model robustness.
